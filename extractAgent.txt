process description: a) An offer is required to be done by the sales department of a specific company. At this point, the commercial manager has to perform a feasibility check based on the business requirements & needs to ensure that the offer is feasible. b) If the offer is not feasible, the customer has to be informed and at this point the process ends after informing him. c) If the offer is feasible, the personnel needs & availability has to be checked. After clarifying the availability based on the business resources, the offer has to be created by the commercial employee and the process ends at creating the offer.
