    "text": "a) Upon receipt of a Service to be executed by the production department, the necessary master data needs to be maintained by the Production Assistant using SAP ECC System. b) First, the necessary master data has to be created (based on the received service order). This contains: Creating work centres, defining their capacities, scheduling as well as defining the link between work and cost centres. c) In creating the work centres, the production assistant has to reference the plant, select the work centre name and define the work centre category (depending on the service to be executed) at the same time. After entering the parameters, the selection has to be confirmed and the system displays the new work centre details. d) Then, the work centre full name has to be selected, the person responsible and its usage (only for routings). e) In the next step the Routing (Service) needs to be defined. In this subprocess, following routing steps are to be defined: standard key value (service) has to be selected, enter set-up time, machine time (optional), variable labour time and teardown time. After defining the parameters the Routing for the Service is defined. f) Returning back to the main process (work centre creation screen), the Routing steps are displayed. g) The next tab is to define the work centre capacity. The Capacities parameters: defining the capacity category and selecting the formulas are to be entered at the same time. h) In the next step, the offered capacity by this work centre has to be checked. This can be reached by double-clicking on category (capacity header). This capacity header may be entered manually or the header may be referenced to a pre-defined standard category. In order to reference this capacity, the capacity has to be created for this work centre. In this subprocess, the following capacity creation parameters have to be defined at the same time: select plant, select name for “personnel” capacity and select capacity category “002 – Personnel”. The entries has then to be confirmed resulting in displaying standard capacity details. In this step, the following capacity characteristics have to be specified: enter the textual name (reference capacity), select a planner group, define factory calendar ID, enter the base unit of measurement and the personnel time frame and define the number of individual capacities (depending on the Cost Accounting data and the Service Order concerned). Then the entered characteristics have to be confirmed again resulting in calculation of the daily operating time by the system. Finally, the reference capacity has to be saved now and the Capacity is successfully created. i) Returning back to the main process (Work Centre Capacity screen), one may reference now the created capacity by selecting the reference capacity in the header. Both filling header manually and referencing a pre-defined capacity are combined now again and the Capacity is defined. j) The next tab, is to define work centre scheduling, in which the capacity has to be selected and the same formulas as for the capacity in the work centre has to be entered. The entries has then to be confirmed, resulting in displaying the parameters and the info buttons for the formulas. k) The last tab in this process, is to define work and centres link, in which the activity type for all times and again the same formulas have to be indicated. After entering both parameters, work and cost centres link is created. l) Finally, this concludes the necessary entries and the new work centre has to be saved, resulting in maintaining Service Master data successfully."

    "text": "a) Logistic process needs to be defined by the logistics department. First, the goods handling process has to be performed by the Handler based on the Handling Order received. b) In order to perform the goods handling, either a sheet has to be taken from a press or the material feeder has to be loaded to the machine. After doing the task given, efforts of material handling technology has to be determined. If handling the materials have considerable effort, the usage of robots can to be conducted. However, robots need costly image processing systems in order to perform their tasks, which can be mitigated if the process is performed by humans. Furthermore, if the required task is to stack products on a pallet, stationary robots have to be used. If on the other hand, the task is to perform different things (movable), mobile robots has to be used.  In case the material handling has not a considerable effort, the handling task has to be performed by humans. A risk may occur in this step, in that wrong assessment may be determined in considering the material handling efforts. c) Both options are united again to perform goods picking (Service) process by the Picker (based on the picking order & material and goods stock). First, the bundling of object quantities have to be changed (picking order). d) In performing this step, a series of activities have to be performed: First the goods have to be moved for provision. In doing so, goods can be moved mechanically, manually or automatically. Then, provision has to be performed. In this step provision can be performed on central or decentralized way. In choosing central provision goods are brought to a picking place (following “Commodity to the person” principle). The appropriate quantity of products has then to be taken out (based on the degree of automation decision) by the picker. In choosing decentralized provision, goods are to be picked by the picker himself (following “Person to the Commodity” principle). Many risks may occur in this step, which are wrong assessment, wrong product & product quantity and broken load units. After that, the goods has to be transported to a transport container for delivery, the goods have to be discharged, the picking unit has to be transported for delivery and finally the picking unit has to be delivered. e) After performing all picking processes, the packaging (Service) process starts in that goods & packaging has to be unified by the Logistic assistant (based on the packaging order). Packaging protection function has to be set as a control in this step to mitigate mechanical & climatic loads and theft occurring in this activity. f) After performing this step, actual packaging process & providing the packaging for transport are to be done at the same time. In this both options, a high disposal logistical effort may occur. In order to mitigate this risk, reusable packaging has to be used in this performance. g) Both options are united again to transit & transport (Service) goods process by the Warehouse assistant using the Transport Order received."

    "text": "a) Upon receipt of a Commitment & Invoice process by the monetary department, the Funds Committer needs to post a funds commitment in SAP ECC System based on the Service details. b) To post the funds commitment, the following entries need to be defined at the same time: document type 11 “Commitment without workflow” has to be selected and also company code and currency have to be defined. c) In the next step, commitment posting details has to be defined at the same time, which are: commitment item, funds centre, fund and functional area. d) After entering the posting details, the document has to be saved. e) In the next step, one may refer to the posting report to see the result of the posting. In the Initial screen following entries needs to be defined: the funds, the funds centre group CVALL and the CI Group CIVITAS. Executing the entries, displays the posting report. f) The next step in this process has to be done by the Accounts Payable department, in which the AP Processor first receives the invoice from the external service provider (Infrastructure). g)Upon receipt of the Invoice, the AP_Processor needs to post the invoice (create payment request). However, to perform this step, two important processes have to be performed first, which are: Maintaining Vendor Master Data & Creating a Cost Centre (CC). h) In the Initial screen in maintaining vendor master data, vendor, company code, purchasing organization and Account group has to be specified at the same time.  In the next tab vendor address data has to be specified. After that, European VAT ID and tax file number needs to be maintained. The next entry is to define the bank details. In the next tab, the reconciliation account “part of CI Group CIVITAS document) has to be specified following by defining payment terms and Incoterms. After entering the vendor details, the new vendor may be now saved resulting in Vendor master data maintained. The next process which is creating a cost centre (CC) has to be performed in order to maintain the cost centre assignment. In the Initial screen, a name for the CC and the validity period have to be defined. Confirming the entries afterwards, displays the master data screen. In this screen, following entries has to be defined at the same time: the name, the person responsible, the cost centre category (Service), the business area, the currency and also the cost centre has to be assigned to the cost centre group. One may save the entries now and as a result, the Cost Centre Assignment is maintained now. j) Bundling the vendor master data and the cost centre assignment, creates the payment request. k) In the Initial screen, the document type “KR – Vendor Invoice”, the newly created vendor (using Vendor master data), the current period, the commitment item, the fund and the funds center are to be defined. l) In the next screen, the tax code and enabling automatic tax calculation has to be defined. The newly created Cost Centre has also to be further assigned. m) The AP Processor may save the Posting, resulting in displaying the Payment Request in the Posting Report. n) In the next step, the AP Processor can display the document and the system will display the document status “Parked”. In this case he has to release the parked document, which can be done by customizing the document. o) In customizing the document, the AP Processor has to assign request category to FI document type, in which the request category “payment request” has to be further linked to the document type. Then, he has to control the processing of request categories, in which the workflow has to be further assigned to the specific request type. p) After completing the Customizing process, he may now post the payment request. In order to do so, posting details has to be defined. Executing the Entries, results in displaying a list of matching documents. q) The corresponding document has to be selected via checkbox and then the document has to be posted. Finally, the Commitment and Invoice process is successfully maintained."

    "text": "a) Upon receipt of an Internal Refurbishment request by the Maintenance department, the responsible maintenance has to create a PM Notification in SAP S/4 HANA System. b) Then, he has to choose the notification type P1 – Maintenance Request. In the Initial screen, the notification parameters have to be defined. First, the responsible maintenance has to define the notification characteristics tab, which contains defining functional location, equipment, planner group and maintenance work centre. After that the entries may be confirmed and as a result the “Warranty check is performed by the system”. Then, the responsible maintenance has to define the reference object tab, in which he can attach documentations. The last parameter in this step is defining malfunction data tab. In this step, if the notification is subject to a breakdown case, then the breakdown checkbox has to be marked. If on the other hand, the notification is not subject to a breakdown case, the breakdown checkbox should not be marked. c) After entering the required parameters for the three tabs, the PM Notification has to be saved. As a result, a confirmation message containing “Notification … saved” will be displayed. d) In the next step, the responsible maintenance has to send the notification to be approved/released. In this step, he has to define details to the receiver of the confirmation and define also the notice text at the same time. The entries may be then confirmed and the process can be saved afterwards. A confirmation message containing “MAIL Request … created” will appear upon saving the process. e) The Maintenance Manager will then receive the maintenance request. At this step, he has to evaluate the request and then document/submit his decision. f) If the decision is approved, then he has to change the PM Notification and set the notification status. The status should be changed from (0001 – Waiting for Approval) to (0002 – Approved (Maintenance)).       The entries has then to be confirmed and also the maintenance manager has to select the put in process icon and save the entries. As a result, a confirmation message containing “Notification … saved” will appear upon saving. g) If on the other hand, the request will not be approved, the maintenance manager has also to change the PM Notification and set the notification status. The status should be changed from (0001 – Waiting for Approval) to (0005 – Cancelled (Maintenace)). The entries has then to be saved and a confirmation message containing “Notification … saved” will also appear in this step. h) The responsible maintenance is to receive the maintenance request decision now. If the request was approved, then he has to manage the work order and create an internal refurbishment order.  Then the informations has to be transferred from the notification to the work order. The order type “MC04” has also to be further defined. At this stage, the responsible maintenance has to define the interval of refurbishment plants and define the valuation type at the same time. The next step is to define the operations. Common outgoing cross-reference risks in this area are Materials shortage & Capacity Overdraft. i) In defining the operations, the responsible maintenance has to maintain Internal Operations and External Operations at the same time. j) For the Internal Operations, planning & scheduling of the work order has to be performed by the Maintenance Planner, which produce a sub-process called Planning & Scheduling of Work Orders. k) Receiving a Request for Planning work centre internal operations triggers this sub-process to start. In the first step, the maintenance planner has to plan the internal operations. At this step, following parameters have to be defined (based on the PM Notification and the Internal Refurbishment Order) at the same time, which are: defining the plant, the description, the control key “PM01” and the working hours. Upon entering the required parameters, the work order approval has to be created. To create this approval, one operations has to be added in the work order with “WCM” as a control key, which triggers the activation of the work approval action. After that, the maintenance planner has to plan the resources. Common risk in this area is Materials shortage. To plan the resources, the material availability (Stock/Requirements list) has to be further checked. In the Initial screen in checking the material availability, following parameters are to be entered at the same time: define plant & define the material used in the work order. After that the entries have to be executed and as a result, the list of reservations (materials) is displayed. The Maintenace planner has then to display the corresponding reservation for the work order. If the materials are at this step available, then the materials used in the work order has to be reserved. If on the other hand, the materials are not available, then the required materials have to be ordered and the request of the order has to be dispatched to the purchasing department. In the next step, the maintenance planner, has to plan the capacity (check capacity). Common risk in this area is Budget Capacity overdraft. In the Initial screen, the work order number has to be defined and the entry has to be again executed. As a result, the Capacity evaluation screen is displayed. After that the maintenance planner has to schedule the work order and finally the planning & scheduling of the work centre internal operations is successfully completed. l) Returning back to the main process “Internal Refurbishment Request” and after defining the internal & external operations, the responsible maintenance may now define the estimated costs. Possible economic risk in this area is Budget overdraft. m) The involved partners (External service providers) in the work order processing may then be maintained. After that the allocated objects to the work order, the additional data and the location data have to be further defined. n) After defining all necessary data, the work order may be now saved, resulting in displaying a confirmation message containing “Order … saved with notification …”. o) The last step in this process is to assign the work order to a WBS Element and finally the Internal Refurbishment request is successfully handled."

    "text": "a) Upon realizing that Heating with renewable Energy is required by a Natural/Legal Person from the Federal Office of Economics and Export Control, the heating method have to be decided on. b) At this point, the natural/legal person has to differentiate if he requires heating up to and including 100 kilowatts of nominal heat output (Option A) or heating up to and including 100 square meters of collector area (Option B). c) For Option A, the natural/legal person may either heat using biomass plants or heat using heating pump systems. d) In the case of heating with biomass plants, the biomass plants have to be decided on (taking in consideration Funding guidelines & requirements). On deciding on the biomass plant, the natural/legal person may either choose the boiler for burning biomass pellets and wood chips, the combination boiler for burning biomass pellets or wood chips and firewood, pellet stoves with water pocket, a retrofit system with a device for calorific value or a retrofit system with a dust reduction device. e) After deciding on the biomass plant, the funding option have to be selected. At this point two options are available which are: Fund plants in existing buildings or Fund plants in new buildings. f) The natural/legal person can further choose for the first option (fund plants in existing buildings) either basic funding or additional funding (taking also in consideration the funding guidelines & requirements) g) The basic funding can be chosen if a heating system is already available and also installed for at least two years (existing building). At this point a common risk may occur in that, the heating system is missing/Heating system is installed for less than two years, which will in result not meet the basic funding requirements. After that the biomass plant for the basic funding has to be selected. Biomass plant options are the following: selecting the wood chip boiler with buffer storage, the pellet boiler with new buffer storage, the pellet stove with water pocket or the log wood gasification boiler with buffer storage. After selecting the biomass plant and meeting the requirements at this step, basic funding as a result is chosen. h) The additional funding, on the other hand, can be chosen by the natural/legal person and is further divided in four types. The first type is to receive a combination bonus for biomass systems. In order to receive this bonus, a simultaneous establishment of an eligible solar thermal or heat pump system and a connection of the biomass plant to a heating network are needed. The second type is to receive a building efficiency bonus. At this point, the natural/legal person will receive 50% of the basic funding. In order to receive this 50%, bonus, the system must be built in an efficient residential building (part of the building stock), the building must meet the requirements for a KfW Efficiency House 55 and an Online Confirmation from an approved expert have to be submitted. The third type is to receive investment grants for optimization measures. In this step the natural/legal person will receive an optimization bonus. The fourth type is to receive an incentive program for energy efficiency (APEE). In this program, inefficient old systems will be replaced with modern heating systems and as a result, the natural/legal person will receive an optimization for the entire heating system. i) Combining all four types, will result in choosing additional funding. j) The second funding option (Option B) is to fund plants in new building. At this point the natural/legal person will receive support for the construction/retrofitting of biomass plants. k) Support devices in this area are: Condensing technology (exhaust gas heat exchanger) and dust reduction (particle separator). l) For option A, if the natural/legal person decides to heat using heating pump systems, he has also to decide first on the heat pump. At this point he may either choose combined water heating and space heating of buildings, exclusive room heating of buildings, exclusive space heating of non-residential buildings or provision of heat for heating networks. m) For Option B, if the natural/legal person requires heating up to and including 100 square meters of collector area, he has to heat using solar thermal systems. At this point the solar thermal system required for heating has to be decided on, which can be the following: choosing exclusive water heating, exclusive space heating, combined water and space heating, supply of heat in heating networks, supply in cold in cooling networks or choosing solar refrigeration. n) After deciding on the heat pump and the solar thermal system, both options can be combined (Loop), to select the funding option. o) The natural/legal person here again can choose to fund plants in existing buildings or in new buildings. p) As for fund plants in existing buildings, two options are further available which are: Option A – Basic & Additional Funding and Option B – Innovation & Additional Funding. q) For Option A: the natural/legal person is to receive basic funding upon to the requirements: Heating System available and heating system installed for at least two years (existing building). Again here a common risk may occur in that, the heating system is missing/heating system installed for less than two years. r) For Option B: the natural/legal person is to receive innovation funding upon to the requirements: Heat pumps with high annual performance figures and heat pumps with improved system efficiency are existing. s) Both options (A & B) can be combined again to receive additional funding, which are further divided into 5 types. The first type is to receive a combination bonus for efficient heat pumps upon to the requirements: simultaneous establishment of an eligible solar thermal or biomass plant, simultaneous construction of a solar collector system and connection of the heat pump to a heating network. Common risks in receiving the combination bonus are that, heat pumps being not connected to a heating network and solar collector system missing. For the second requirement: “Simultaneous construction of a solar collector system”, the natural/legal person has to further meet the requirements for the construction which are: Gross collector area being at least 7 m² and contribution as a heat source for the heat pump existing. Common risk in this point is again: Gross collector area being less than 7 m². The second type is to receive load management capability fund, at which the system interfaces enables the heat pump. The natural/legal person has to meet the requirements at this point which are: Simultaneous construction of a storage facility with a volume of at least 30 liters per kilowatt and existing “Smart Grid Ready” certificate or a manufacturer’s declaration (Requirements met). The third type is to receive building efficiency bonus, for which the natural/legal person will receive 50% of the basic funding upon to the requirements: System built in an efficient residential building (part of the building stock), Building meets the requirements for a KfW Efficiency House 55 and Online Application form an approved expert submitted. Common risk in this step that the building does not meet the KfW Efficiency House 55 Requirements. The fourth option is to receive investment grants for optimization measures. In this step, the natural/legal person will receive optimization bonus The fifth option is to receive an incentive program for energy efficiency (APEE). In this program, inefficient old systems are replaced with modern heating systems and as a result, the natural/legal person will receive an optimization of the entire heating system. t) Combining all three heating methods, the contractor has to fill in the heat funding application (Online Application Heating Method). u) The first step in filling the online application is to enter the data. At this stage the contractor has to enter the following data at the same time: specify information on data protection law, specify the information about the start of the project, define the details of the applicant person, specify the information about the location of the plant & the building, specify the information about the planned heating measure, specify the information about the type of funding (Basic funding, Additional funding or Innovation Funding), enter personal explanations for the planned measure and submit declaration of consent for electronic communication. v) For the point define details of the applicant person, “Individual defined”, “Freelance person defined”, “Company defined”, “Contractor defined”, “Local Authorities defined” “Companies in which the majority of municipalities are involved”, “Registered association defined”, “Schools and Churches defined” or “Agriculture, forestry and horticulture defined” can be selected. w) In specifying the information about the location of the plant & the building, the contractor has to define the type of old heating and also define the date of installation of the heating system at the same time. An Incoming Cross-reference risk in these two steps is: Heating system being less than two years installed. x) For the point define the type of old heating, “Oil/Gas Heating defined”, “Night Storage Heater defined”, “Single Oven defined”, “Biomass Plant defined”, “Heat Pump defined”, “District Heating Connection defined”, or “Coal Heating defined” may be selected. y) In the next step, all entered data have to be combined so that the contractor checks the entered data. z) After checking the entered data, he can upload the required files and confirm the data. As a result the Online Application is filled and the contractor can submit the application. Finally the Heating with renewable Energy application is successfully submitted."

    "text": "a) The Accounts Receivable (AR) department has received a request to perform the revenue forecast & revenue process in SAP ECC System. b) The AR Processor needs first to post the forecast revenue. In the Initial screen, following parameters have be defined at the same time: defining document type “11”, document date, posting date and company code. c)Upon entering the parameters, the posting details of the forecast has to be further defined. The AR Processer has then to note the fund & the functional area. d) Then the document has to be saved. Like in the Commitment & Invoice process, one may refer to the posting report, resulting in displaying the forecast posting. e) In the next step, the individual customer has to be created (depending on the Customer & Sales Accounting data) using SAP ECC and CRM (Customer Relationship Management System). The AR Processor has to create completer customer (complete in this context means sales & accounting data of a customer). f) Then, the newly created customer has to be assigned to a sales organization and to a company code. g) First step in this is to define the Account group which is customer general. h) In the Initial screen in defining the customer, following entries need to be defined at the same time: which are first to define the payment transaction tab, in which the customer’s bank account has to be defined. In the next tab, the company code data has to be defined, in which the reconciliation account 140000 has to be defined and the G/L account 140000 has to be also checked. i) After entering the required parameters, the AR Processor may now save the customer and as a result a confirmation message containing “Customer .. created”. j) In the next step, the revenues has to be posted against the cost centre. A common risk in this step is that the cost centre may be blocked against revenue posting.  To prevent this, the cost centre created for Commitment & Invoice process has to be checked in that it is not blocked against revenue posting. The AR Processor has then to display the control tab in cost centre. If the cost centre is blocked against revenue posting, then a new cost centre without revenue posting blocking has to be created. If on the other hand the cost centre is not blocked, then the acceptance request can be created. k) In the next step, the AR Processor has to create the payment request. In the Initial screen, following parameters are to be defined at the same time: defining document type “DR”, indicate the customer, defining the period, the commitment item, the fund, the funds center, the G/L account, the amount and the cost centre has to be also assigned to the acceptance request. l) After entering the required parameters, the document has to be saved. m) The AR processor may now display the document and as a result, the document status is “parked”. n) Following the same procedure like in the Commitment & Invoice process, the parked posting has to be released, in which the document has to be further customized. o) In the customization process, the request category has to be assigned to FI document type and the request category “acceptance request” has to be further linked to the document type. Then the processing of request categories has to be controlled and the workflow has to be assigned to the specific request type. p) The acceptance request can now be posted and finally the Revenue forecast process is successfully completed by the posting."
