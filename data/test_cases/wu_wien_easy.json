    "text": "a) On receiving an order, to implement a Project, the Controlling department starts to plan the project based on the project informations and business requirements, needs & resources. b) On planning the project the Controller has to define budget planning during mid-term planning phase (based on the MTP document), define internal & external costs based on the department budget at the same time. c) Then, the controller has to obtain budget for the project and submit budget request using the Application for Budget Release (ABR). d) If the budget is not approved the process starts again at planning the project phase. Once the budget is approved, the project has to be set up in SAP by the Controller. e) In the next step, he runs & keeps tracks of the project in SAP. At this stage a Budget overdraft risk may occur. f) If the budget is exceeded, the controller has to get budget again for the project. In case the budget is not exceeded, he has to close the project and the process ends at implementing the project successfully."

    "text": "a) Vendor Evaluation needs to be maintained for a particular group of vendors by the Purchasing department using SAP Material Management (MM) System. b) On receiving a vendor evaluation request, vendors have to be evaluated in SAP by an MM Employee. The purchasing organization and vendors have to be specified at the same time. c) Then, the performance of the vendors on basis of the main criteria scores available in the system have to be compared. In case the main criteria entered in the system are not enough for the evaluation process, further main criteria can be maintained in the system. d) After deciding on entering further main criteria or not, one can assign different weights to the individual criteria in the system. e) In the next step, subcriteria out of the main criteria can be further defined. After this point, the scores calculation method for sub criteria has to be decided on. f) There are three methods for calculating subcriteria scores, which are evaluating vendors manually, semi-automatically or fully-automatically. g) When vendors are evaluated manually, scores for a subcriterion per vendor have to be entered in the system. h) On evaluating vendors based on the semi-automatically method, the scores have to be defined at info record level. i) In the fully automatically method, the system computes scores on basis of the existing database. j) After deciding on the evaluating method and entering the required steps afterwards, the evaluation has to be saved and as a result the vendors’ overall scores are calculated. k) Based on these calculated scores, performance of the vendors have to be measured. One can also display vendor rank list for comparing performance and finally the evaluation process for vendors is successfully maintained."

    "text": "a) Sales and Operations Planning (SOP) needs to be maintained in the Production department by the Production Assistant using SAP ERP system to derive the independent & dependent demand. b) First, to create the independent demand, the planning data needs to be transferred to demand management. In doing this, demand transfer parameters like: “specifying the material”, “specifying the plant”, “selecting a time frame”, “inserting the planning data” and “defining the requirements type” are to be defined at the same time. c) In the next step, the entries has to be confirmed and as a result the transferred planned data version are displayed. To complete the transfer, “transfer now” field has to be selected. In doing so, the independent demand are created now. d) The dependent demand now has to be derived from the independent demand, which is done with Material Requirements Planning (MRP) – this step is based on the Bill of materials (BOM), the routings and the capacity of the work centers concerned. e) The MRP run needs to be executed now and the MRP parameters (using Planning data) are to be defined. f) MRP Parameters to be determined at the same time are: “specifying the plant”, specifying the processing key – Regenerative Planning (NEUPL) will be used as processing key, based on the plant master data”, “specifying category of Purchase Requisition – based on the Purchase Requisition for the Planning data”, “specifying category of delivery schedule lines – taking into account delivery schedule lines”,  “specifying category of MRP list”, “defining planning mode – this field allows alternative entries: Reactivate planning dates, delete planning dates or re-explode BOM” and “defining scheduling”. g) After defining the MRP parameters, all entries have to be confirmed. Upon confirming, the system displays a warning message “Please check input parameters”. Executing the entries again, results in exploding the BOM and determining the dependent requirements. In this step the system basically checks two options: to purchase the materials (create PRs – through external service providers) or to produce the materials in-house (create planned production orders). Both options are then united again and the dependent demand is created/derived. h) Finally, the independent & dependent demand created are combined and the Sales and Operations Planning (SOP) process is successfully maintained."

    "text": "a) The production department received a chocolate production order. Upon receipt of the order, the production manager has to book the order in SAP. b) Then, the recipe for the chocolate production order has to be managed and the feedback has to be sent to the Material Management (MM) department. c) Upon sending the feedback, the MM processor checks afterwards, the materials availability (based on the materials availability document) using SAP MM and has to inform the purchaser. d) On performing the materials availability check, either the materials are available and in that case the production process has to be prepared by the MM processor or if the materials are not available an order has to be carried out/placed by the purchaser and then the production process can be prepared. e) Both options leads then to inform the operators to start the production (based on the production process, production recipe and the order itself). f) In the next stage, the chocolate production process starts by the Operators. g) Based on the production recipe, the production process & and the order, the cocoa beans have to be roasted and grinded, the cocoa powder has to be created and the cocoa mass has to be created and pressed. h) After that, the cocoa cake & cocoa butter are created at the same time. Upon creating the option cocoa butter, the aroma has to be stirred and the milk has to be mixed at the same time and then the chocolate mass is created. The chocolate mass has then to be shaped and as a result the chocolate is created. After creating the second option (the cocoa butter), the cocoa cake has to be broken. i) Both options are afterwards combined again to carry out packaging and finally the production order is successfully produced."

    "text": "a) The purchasing department needs to assign material master records to vendors in SAP ERP System, in order to know which materials are to be purchased from which vendor. b) The first step in this process is to create an info record by the purchasing employee. c) In the initial screen, info record parameters have to be defined, which are: the vendor, the material, the purchasing organization and the plant. d) After that, the entries may be confirmed now. e) In the next step, info records general data have to be defined. The purchasing employee needs to specify reminder parameter 1, 2 and 3 in this step. f) After defining the general data, the purchasing organization data have to be defined also. Following entries have to be defined at the same time: planned delivery time, purchasing group, standard quantity and the net price. After that, the entries have to be confirmed again. g) In the next step, the conditions have to be defined in which discounts have to be added. h) In order to add a discount, the condition type “RA01” and the percentage rate have to be defined. Upon entering the percentage rate, the system calculates the price automatically. i) After that,  the entries may be confirmed again, and the purchasing employee may now assign purchased items to sources (vendors) and the process is finally completed by Assigning Material Master Records successfully to vendors."

    "text": "a) Upon receipt of a production order in the production department, checks has to be performed by the production assistant using SAP ERP. b) First check is to perform scheduling check (Scheduling service). In this step basically scheduling has to be carried out by selecting the function. A confirmation message -Scheduling carried out- confirms this task performance. c) Then, material availability check has to be performed. Common risks in this step, is that quantities are designed as ATP-quantities (available to promise) and that the same order are repeatedly created and processed. In the next step, Material ATP-check function has to be selected. In performing this check, materials can be either available or not available. If the materials are available a confirmation message -All checked materials in order ... are available- is displayed. If, on the other hand, the materials are not available, the components view of the production order & the plant stock of the material have to be further checked and the process ends at this stage. d) Then next check is to perform capacity check (which is based on work centers & capacity).  Common risk in this check is that work centers/capacity may be overloaded.  To perform this check, the capacity availability check function has to be selected. If the capacity is available, a positive capacity check confirmation message -Capacity available at all work centers- is displayed. If on the other hand, the capacity is not available, the overload list (ascertaining work centers) has to be checked and the process ends at this stage. e) The last check to be performed is to analyze costs (based on the material costs & production lot). To perform this check, calculate costs function has to be selected. After selecting the function, a confirmation message -Costs determined --> see cost display- is displayed. f) After performing all checks, all options are then combined again, resulting in production order successfully checked."

    "text": "a) Upon realizing that Damages Compensation Entitlement is to be checked by the Ministry of Justice, the responsible lawyer has to determine the type of liability using §1311 ABGB and Damages Compensation Processing System. After determining liability of fault, he has to check the requirements using §1295 ABGB, which includes defining the type of damage, defining the type of causing (causality), checking illegality and checking fault. b) For defining the type of damage, either a financial loss (material damage) or an immaterial damage (ideal damage) is determined by the lawyer. c) In the case of financial loss (material damage) is determined, he has to further determine the type of financial loss. The lawyer may either detect positive damage or lost profit. d) If, on the other hand, immaterial damage (ideal damage) is determined, the lawyer has to determine again the type of immaterial damage. This type of damage can either be Pain compensation (bodily harm) or Value of special preference. e) For defining the type of causing (causality), the lawyer has first to check the equivalence. For checking the equivalence, following question is raised “Would the damage not have occurred without the behavior of the damaging party?” f) If the answer is yes, then then damages compensation remains intact. If the answer is no, then the damages compensation will not be granted. g) After checking the equivalence, the lawyer has to further check the adequacy, at which the following question is raised “Is the act suitable for causing the damage (according to General Life Experience)?”. If the answer is yes, then again the damages compensation remains intact. If the answer is no, then the damages compensation will not be granted. h) For checking illegality, the lawyer has to determine the illegality type, at which either a breach of the law’s precepts/prohibitions or a violation of good morals is detected. i) For the last requirement in this point, which is checking fault, he has to check the accessibility of  the damaging behavior. j) After that he has to further differentiate according to intensity. At this point either an Intent (intentional damage) or a Negligence is detected. k) If a Negligence is detected, he has to further determine the type of negligence, in which either a gross negligence or slight negligence is found. l) After differentiating according to the intensity of the negligence and checking the requirements for the liability of fault, the responsible judge has to decide on the extent of the compensation. m) If the damage is a financial loss, he has to determine the respective extent for it. n) Depending on the extent of negligence, if it is a slight negligence “partial satisfaction” , then a Replacement of the objective market value has to be considered. If a gross “full satisfaction” is detected, then a compensation for the damage incurred and the loss of profit have to be considered. o) If on the other hand, the damage is an immaterial damage, also the respective extent for it has to be determined. At this point, the judge can have of three possibilities, which are: “Pain compensation (bodily harm)” in case of slight/gross “full satisfaction”, “Damages Compensation will not be granted” in case of slight “no satisfaction”, and “Value of special preference compensation” in case of gross “full satisfaction”. p) After determining for both options (financial loss & immaterial damage) the compensation extent, the process ends with Entitlement to damages compensation successfully checked."

    "text": "a) Upon realizing that a Punitive Mandate has to be issued to the accused person (using Punitive Records Information Systems), the municipal authority send the punitive mandate by post. b) The Accused Person then is to receive the punitive mandate. A common risk in this step is that the accused person may be absent. Therefore in case the delivery attempt is successful, the accused person takes over the punitive mandate, which is delivered via ‘Proof of deliver RSb’. In case the delivery attempt is not successful, the postman has to deposit the punitive mandate at the post office. The accused person will then have to take over the punitive mandate from the post office. c) In the next step, the accused person can raise an objection against the Punitive Mandate. The investigation will begin at this point by the Municipal Authority. d) The Municipal Authority has then to check the raised objection, which includes considering given statements from the accused person, checking the facts and hearing existence witnesses. e) After checking the raised objection, the investigation results have to be concluded. f) At this point, if the investigation is completed, the Municipal Authority may either impose a punitive sentence (punitive mandate) or terminate the proceedings without punishment. If on the other hand, the investigation is not completed, they have to investigate the objection further and then conclude the final results, which again are the same two possibilities in case the investigation is completed. g) After concluding the investigation results, the Municipal Authority has to inform the accused person about the investigation results. h) The accused person then is to receive the Investigation results. At this point, if the accused person wants complain, he can raise a complaint against the investigation results. If on the other hand he does not want to raise a complaint, he has to pay the imposed penalty within the specified time. For raising a complaint, he has to differentiate between traffic penalties and Parking meters penalties. If the punitive mandate is traffic penalties, he has to raise the complaint to the administrative court. If on the other hand the punitive mandate is Parking meters penalties, he has to raise the complaint to the Federal Finance Court. i) The Administrative Court/the Federal Finance Court have then to receive the raised complaint. j) Upon receipt of the raised complaint, the respective Court has to check whether the complaint is submitted on time or not. k) In case the complaint is not submitted on time, then the Decision will be considered as final and the respective court will disregard the complaint and send it back to the accused person, which will receive the disregarded complaint and has to pay the imposed penalty (as in the case he didn’t raise a complaint). Upon paying the penalty, the process ends at this step with Punitive Mandate being successfully handled. l) If on the other hand, the complaint is submitted on time, the respective Court has to investigate the complaint and then arrange a trial to which the relevant persons are summoned. The procedure ends then with a submitted decision from the respective court."

For doing this, the maintenance employee must identify the main spare parts (Excel spreadsheet) of the equipment that should be considered as part of the BOM taking into consideration business requirements. b) After that, it must be taken into account if the equipment is an asset or not from the technical point of view. Based on this decision it will be decided if a material BOM or equipment BOM is to be created. c) If the equipment is not an asset, a material BOM has to be created. However, in order to do a material BOM, the material type for the header of the BOM has to be requested. d) If, on the other hand, the equipment is an asset (based on the technical characteristics of the equipment), an equipment BOM has to be created. e) After deciding on the type of the BOM to be created, the maintenance responsible has to check if the material number is existing for the spare parts. f) In case the material numbers is available, then it has to be added to the excel template. If on the other hand, the material numbers is not available, it has to be requested. g) After receiving the material numbers for the BOM, it has to be added to the respective excel template. h) Finally, for both options, the filled excel template has to be sent to the Integrity & Maintenance department to be checked from the technical point of view and the process ends in completing this stage."
